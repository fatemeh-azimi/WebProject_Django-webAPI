This project is built with REST API in Django framework and its users can login or register through Google accounts, Facebook etc.
By designing a hierarchical database and using Django's ORM, optimal queries can be made on the database. What is observed in this project. :)

Standard test writing has been observed in this project.


My project is a blog repository that can operate in a field, for example, tourism. In this way, it has a large blog section with all the facilities and has its own main and communication pages. Those who are interested can post their travel experiences on the blog, of course, after becoming one of the authors of the site.
